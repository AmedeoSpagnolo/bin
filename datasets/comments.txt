It would be great if you add wifi hotspot/theathering feature in it. As some timea guest has to acces their mail id or other scocial networks  out of hotel which are installed on their own handset. If they got wifi hotspot/theathering it will be great for them.

The phone itself I think is not updated, apps tend to load slower. So hopefully, on our next visit Handy's version will be updated.
The Rubens is a very good hotel--a little away from the center but near a subway stop.  The staff is 1st rate.  The 3 unanswered questions are not applicable as I did not use them.
All in, satisfied
No
The charging of the handy is bad, I cannot charge and need to get the reception to do it for me.
Device tethering didn't appear to work. Instant messaging didn't work. The handset was slow to respond and clunky to use. Interface was more geared towards advertising than intuitive usage.
the changement of interface is too slow

Not really, I was very impressed.

Push mesages.
To be perfectly honest, I didn't trust I wouldn't somehow end up with a bill/debt to pay at the end of my holiday. I would have used it a lot more if I was sure there was no expense with using it.
I think I needed to I mprove to scare to use in case I broke it
Noo

If you can allow it to act as a mobile wifi will be better. A lot of confidential information is in my phone..therefore I will rather not use Handy too much especially app which has password.
Add unlimited calls to other international countries even.

More offers for tours
Please allow it to access 4G - the speed was too slow to be functional. Battery would barely last 2 hours on standby, less than an hour if we were using it
It was a little slow/clunky to use particularly when switching between apps; it would often pause for a while.

Good job on handy, i dont think i have any suggestion as I am so pleased with the service :)

Not enough time to fully utilize it to a fair comment.

The touch screen sometimes not working properly.

I believe the functionality has a ways to go yet ...... but I used it for making and taking local calls, and as a foreigner that was useful.

Thoroughly enjoyed using this device, helped us immensely with transport and ideas
Difficult to charge if not placed perfectly in charger
Fast processor of the phone because it lags. Fast data connection as well if possible.

it's very satisfying already


Some of feature listed in the survey was not known. Dialling a ext no was not great. Maybe a user set code will be easier to remember like lockers in the room
Initially battery would not charge.  Then kept asking for pin number.  Took to front desk various times and they could not get it to work.

Very happy and good experience first time .  I use somuch but I see Somany new features right now in survey. Thanks
The phone was too slow. I think the memory on the handset was inadequate for the features that was packed in. But overall it was OK..! The calls, Internet, Maps and ability to install your apps were very useful

The phone itself is too laggy which makes it almost unusable.  The service is good just that the phone needs to be replaced with better ones.
No.   During my stay I remember accepting an offer from my HK mobile provider for unlimited data etc.   In having that available to me I seem to remember not needing the Handy device once I accepted the offer.    Although, I like the idea and was curious to learn more when i first saw the device in my room.

Improve the overall speed of the phone. I have used the handy sets on 2 of my trips, both times they were very laggy. And the battery life. The phone would just last half a day , even with minimum phone usage .


Nothing


Battery life is very less

We couldn't figure out how to use it so it was pretty pointless.  We are iPhone users and used to much quicker reaction time from a phone.  Took me a long while to realise that it was responding but very slowly. Also there was not list in the room stating which countries you could dial for free (I had been assured at reception it would be in the room).    The idea is great but learning to use a new phone for anyone over the age of 30 is not as easy as one might think.

shoul be have social Media App, like WA


What the users can do should be mentioned. Didnt know about the unlimited calls

Found making calls complicated

WiFi connection to my own smartphone for share the internet access at outside hotel.
Not that I can think of
Reception staff should provide prime about this facility at the time of hotel check in .



i dont think it is great that hotel provide us handy
It's perfect other than the speed of the phone.
The phone hardware is now quite old, possibly due to android version upgrade. The unit took 10 hours to sync my Google contacts, requiring me to use my own phone for the contact details. On my previous visit a couple of years ago, the phone was much faster. Now the handset reports no contact information for at least 30 seconds every time the contact app is started. Please upgrade the hardware.
No.  It was excellent for an overseas visitors.  It would be great if all countries offered it to their guests.  thank you.
it takes a long time to start up and shut down.  It also takes quite long to connect to overseas phone call.  If both timing can be improved would rate it 5.
Make International calls to more destinations free.
No need it is already prefect
Restaurant recommends
PHONE BATTERY SHOULD B 4000 MAH
Improve battery life
Please include Philippines to unlimited international calls


map is not correct and sensitive enough
The one in our room was super slow, and barely worked. It kept exiting the wifi signal every few minutes and timing out. It's a cool idea but the phones are really bad quality. Investing in iPhones would be smart.
new unit maybe
Satisfied. It's differentiated service.





The cost at the places we went to would be good. I booked online to places like the zoo thinking it was cheaper however, It was cheaper purchasing at the zoo

Excellent option

love the idea but not all that easy to use and perhaps it would be better to offer handy services by allowing clients to download the app rather than carry a second handset and the app provides free data and international calls etc

During our stay there is a fire alarm. No accouncement was made over the Public announcement system or hotel staff.
Great feature for the hotel.
As a local tourist, I do not require international phone calls function much, though it is still a nice function to have. Simple instruction manual could be provided to make it easier for me to use. I had difficulty handling it as I am iphone user, not familiar with android system. Also, it would be very useful if I could access housekeeping via an app and request for housekeeping assistance, like asking for extra towels, defective hairdryer etc.
i loved it. I wish it was easier to setup, maybe the hotel could inform me about it. Initially when I came across the phone in my room, I was worried, I would be charged exorbitantly high fees for using it. I had no idea what the phone was for quite some time , and had to read up and confirm it was indeed a complimentary offering. Now that I know, I look forward to using it next time around.

Nil. The current features are sufficient for any tourists regardless leisure or business trips, to aid in the convenience while in Hong Kong. Thank you.



Battrey life very short. Not user friendly.

Clearer 'ow to use' instructions to get the most of the functions
Can update us to VIP Best Discount Rate. Would be coming back again. Planning to review your rooms and facilitate for future Seminars and Stay. Thanks.

Reminded me of my first smartphone of ten years ago
So we used our phones (but my daughter played with it). In our case we never even really considered using handy. But I must admit it was nice to offer such a service.
Maybe an automatic - best way back to the hotel one is staying at.
Local suggestions for restaurants and caf√©.



no very satisfied

I could only get ads on the phone so didn't use, the concept was good, 5 couples stayed with us no one could get the phone working correctly
I didn't know the Handy phone needs to be charged for extra fees from hotel...! I've heard that handy phone is free so I started using it without second thought when I saw it in my room. However when checking out, the reception asked if I used handy phone during my stay and showed me the charging notice! I was shocked honestly, and thank god they said I didn't have to pay if I wasn't know it's a paid service.
I'm not sure if the charging request is from handy or the hotel. If it's from handy, then I wouldn't prefer using it anymore since I rented the wifi router in my home country. However, if the charging request is from hotel, then it makes no sense to me either for it should be an additional value, part of the hotel service instead of we should pay for it. I hope handy could explain to me which way of working, so I could know if I should consider using handy service in my next trip to HK.

Look  did not really use it fully as I had my own phone , set up the way I like. Did not have anyone in HK to ring, nor use international calls
Needs to be easier to access apps. Get to google maps etc needs to be a lot easier. Don't make me go to an address client's website every time I open the phone. Let me get to my calling app.
I've not used handy before so it was very new to me found it quite easy when I worked out how to use it.


The hand mobile phone that was in our room did not work and we had to take it to reception twice to have it checked but we were not shown how to use it so we ended up not worrying about because our stay was almost over by then. So we did not get to get the benefits of this feature.

Can be use to receive phone calls


I thought it was an excellent tool!

Is very  good now

excellent inovation

so far it is enough

Uber

A better explication on this tool
I want to be sure that all my personal data, accounts (wechat, email, etc.) will be cleared from the device after I leave it. It must be standard service, so that I don't care about my personal data after I leave - I just install what I need and use all the features, and the next customer after me receives the device flushed to default state.
For city guide, I beleive it must start not from reclama, but from my query - what I want to find. Nearby facilities first. A list of offers, than position on map, then route how to get there.
Was very nice to have this phone... so nice surprise !! Thanks

Battery life to last longer

Family sized room


None, it's good as it is

Can't think of any!
Couldn't find the phone app. So the unlimited phone calls were useless. Maybe make the phone a bit easier to navigate.

My own phone ran out of charge when I was taking picture s of Victoria bay in the fog. I took some on the handy phone. The camera is not great compared to most phones on the market nowadays, but it didn't matter in the end because I couldn't figure out how to get them off! There were plenty of options to try, but all of them failed and I couldn't figure out why.  There isn't much online support available, it turns out.
A handset that works
Wasn't explained what it was! Discovered on the last day by accident.




Better camera. Better performance (experienced lags and glitches). More space. Better security (screen lock with password).

Taxi app, public transportation app, tourist navigation - not just a list, but complete navigation to the locations (and I don't recall having city guide - nor the direct dial to the reception, for that matter), shopping/market portal (where to buy, with prices and contacts, like Yandex.Market in Russia)

the disocunt coupons interface seems complicated. I didnt know i could dial reception with it. Google maps came in very handy. Your form should have an option stating Did not use the feature since many features I did not use, and therefore I cannot grade them.

Inbound calls. Having number with extension is annoying for who calls. Complicated to give and explain to people.

Work with telco, get a pool of numbers and manage them. When customer activates assign number, then wueh customer deactivates, store the number in ageing pool. Reassign after a couple of days or weeks.
Not at the moment.

Cell number is not direct and for example for Uber it is not possible to register it. I didn't know about international unlimited calls.

Maybe you can setup some local taxi provider in your application? It will very helpful. Not a lot of information about possibilities of your device.

But anyway it is a perfect idea for hotel visitors. Thanks!) it was really helpful for me (I used scype, Uber, internet). Maybe if I knew about international calls (Irish colleagues, and German) then I used app for this too. Also I didn't know about tickets (how it use) it's not clear.
Y E S, make sure that your customers can get an PAID invoice statement at the end of the stay.
